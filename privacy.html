    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Boxing Interval Timer ("the App") handles information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>The App is designed to work with minimal data. We do not require an account to use the free version.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data stored on your device:</strong> Your workout history (dates, duration, calories), timer settings (rounds, round duration, rest duration), theme preference (dark/light), sounds on/off, and if you use Pro features, your stats (weight, height, age) for calorie estimation. This data stays on your device and is not sent to our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>In-app purchases:</strong> If you purchase the Pro upgrade, the transaction is processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Play Store). We do not receive or store your payment details. We may receive anonymized purchase confirmation so the App can unlock Pro for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use data stored on your device only to provide the App's features (e.g. showing workout history, applying your settings, estimating calories when you have entered your stats). We do not sell your personal information.</p>

    <h2>3. Third parties</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App may be subject to the privacy policies of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple App Store / Google Play:</strong> for downloading the App and in-app purchases.</li>
      <li><strong>Expo:</strong> the App may be built with Expo; see Expo's privacy documentation for any related processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
    <p>Data stored on your device remains until you delete the App or clear its data. We do not retain copies of that data on our servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
